## Recent Changes

1. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Collapsible value blocks: Each show/episode value block is collapsed by default and can be expanded/collapsed for easier scrolling.
   - Clear labeling: Value blocks are labeled as "Show Value Block," "Episode Value Block," or "Other Value Block."
   - Button order and text: "Load Test Feed" and "Clear Settings" buttons were reordered for better usability. Subtitle updated to: “Look up and test payment splits in podcast value blocks.”
   - Quick Test Feed button is now grouped with Parse and Clear buttons.

2. **Parsing & Compatibility**
   - Robust value block extraction: Handles both show-level and episode-level `<podcast:value>` blocks, with fallbacks for text-based detection.
   - Namespace-agnostic parsing: Uses multiple selectors to handle feeds with or without XML namespaces.
   - Collapsible cards: Only the label and title are shown until expanded, making large feeds manageable.

3. **Backend Proxy**
   - Added a Node.js Express proxy (`proxy.js`) to fetch podcast feeds (HTTP or HTTPS) and serve them to the frontend, bypassing CORS and mixed content issues.
   - Frontend now fetches all feeds via `/proxy?url=...`, enabling support for HTTP feeds like No Agenda.

4. **Code Refactor & Cleanup**
   - `public/script.js` was modularized and cleaned up:
     - Large functions were broken into helpers (fetch, parse, display, feedback).
     - Centralized button feedback and error handling.
     - Consistent formatting, comments, and variable naming.
     - Removed unused/legacy code.
   - All changes were committed and pushed to the repository.

## How the Code Currently Works

- **User Flow:**
  1. User enters a podcast RSS feed URL (or loads a test feed).
  2. User clicks "Parse Value Block."
  3. The frontend sends a request to `/proxy?url=...` to fetch the feed (supports HTTP/HTTPS).
  4. The XML is parsed in the browser, and all `<podcast:value>` blocks (show and episode) are extracted.
  5. Each value block is displayed as a collapsible card, labeled by type.
  6. User can expand/collapse each card to view payment splits (Lightning addresses, node pubkeys, and their splits).

- **Key Features:**
  - Handles both show-level and episode-level splits.
  - Works with modern Podcasting 2.0 feeds and legacy feeds.
  - Fast, user-friendly UI with keyboard shortcuts and interactive feedback.
  - Secure and compatible with both HTTP and HTTPS feeds via backend proxy.
